Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang (president and CEO), Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, it is a software and fabless company which designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing, and system on a chip units (SoCs) for mobile computing and the automotive market. Nvidia is also a dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software.\\nNvidia's professional line of GPUs are used for edge-to-cloud computing and in supercomputers and workstations for applications in fields such as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research, and manufacturing design. Its GeForce line of GPUs are aimed at the consumer market and are used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering, and PC gaming. With a market share of 80.2% in the second quarter of 2023, Nvidia leads the market for discrete desktop GPUs by a wide margin. The company expanded its presence in the gaming industry with the introduction of the Shield Portable (a handheld game console), Shield Tablet (a gaming tablet), and Shield TV (a digital media player), as well as its cloud gaming service GeForce Now.\\nIn addition to GPU design and outsourcing manufacturing, Nvidia provides the CUDA software platform and API that allows the creation of massively parallel programs which utilize GPUs. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. In the late 2000s, Nvidia had moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets and vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. Its competitors include AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, and AI accelerator companies such as Cerebras and Graphcore. It also makes AI-powered software for audio and video processing (e.g., Nvidia Maxine).\\nNvidia's offer to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September 2020 failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny, leading to the termination of the deal in February 2022 in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition. In 2023, Nvidia became the seventh public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion, and the company's valuation has increased rapidly since then as the company became a leader in data center chips with AI capabilities in the midst of the AI boom. In June 2024, for one day, Nvidia overtook Microsoft as the world's most valuable publicly traded company, with a market capitalization of over $3.3 trillion.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Founding ===\\n\\nNvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang (who, as of 2024, remains CEO), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems. The three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a Denny's roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose.\\nAt the time, Malachowsky and Priem were frustrated with Sun's management and were looking to leave, but Huang was on \\\"firmer ground\\\", in that he was already running his own division at LSI. The three co-founders discussed a vision of the future which was so compelling that Huang decided to leave LSI and become the chief executive officer of their new startup.\\nIn 1993, the three co-founders envisioned that the ideal trajectory for the forthcoming wave of computing would be in the realm of accelerated computing, specifically in graphics-based processing. This path was chosen due to its unique ability to tackle challenges that eluded general-purpose computing methods. As Huang later explained: \\\"We also observed that video games were simultan\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC\\\" page=\\\"\\\"/>\\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC or Taiwan Semiconductor) is a Taiwanese multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company. It is the world's most valuable semiconductor company, the world's largest dedicated independent (\\\"pure-play\\\") semiconductor foundry, and Taiwan's largest company, with headquarters and main operations located in the Hsinchu Science Park in Hsinchu, Taiwan. Although the central government of Taiwan is the largest individual shareholder, the majority of TSMC is owned by foreign investors. In 2023, the company was ranked 44th in the Forbes Global 2000. Taiwan's exports of integrated circuits amounted to $184 billion in 2022, accounted for nearly 25 percent of Taiwan's GDP. TSMC constitutes about 30 percent of the Taiwan Stock Exchange's main index.\\nTSMC was founded in Taiwan in 1987 by Morris Chang as the world's first dedicated semiconductor foundry. It has long been the leading company in its field. When Chang retired in 2018, after 31 years of TSMC leadership, Mark Liu became chairman and C. C. Wei became Chief Executive. It has been listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange since 1993; in 1997 it became the first Taiwanese company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Since 1994, TSMC has had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.4% in revenue and a CAGR of 16.1% in earnings.\\nMost fabless semiconductor companies such as AMD, Apple, ARM, Broadcom, Marvell, MediaTek, Qualcomm, and Nvidia are customers of TSMC, as are emerging companies such as Allwinner Technology, HiSilicon, Spectra7, and UNISOC. Programmable logic device companies Xilinx and previously Altera also make or made use of TSMC's foundry services. Some integrated device manufacturers that have their own fabrication facilities, such as Intel, NXP, STMicroelectronics, and Texas Instruments, outsource some of their production to TSMC. At least one semiconductor company, LSI, re-sells TSMC wafers through its ASIC design services and design IP portfolio.\\nTSMC has a global capacity of about thirteen million 300 mm-equivalent wafers per year as of 2020 and produces chips for customers with process nodes from 2 microns to 3 nanometres. TSMC was the first foundry to market 7-nanometre and 5-nanometre (used by the 2020 Apple A14 and M1 SoCs, the MediaTek Dimensity 8100, and AMD Ryzen 7000 series processors) production capabilities, and the first to commercialize ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology in high volume.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nIn 1986, Li Kwoh-ting, representing the Executive Yuan, invited Morris Chang to serve as the president of the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) and offered him a blank check to build Taiwan's chip industry. At that time, the Taiwanese government wanted to develop its semiconductor industry, but its high investment and high risk nature made it difficult to find investors. Texas Instruments and Intel turned down Chang. Only Philips was willing to sign a joint venture contract with Taiwan to put up $58 million, transfer its production technology, and license intellectual property in exchange for a 27.5 percent stake in TSMC. Alongside generous tax benefits, the Taiwanese government, through the National Development Fund, Executive Yuan, provided another 48 percent of the startup capital for TSMC, and the rest of the capital was raised from several of the island's wealthiest families, who owned firms that specialized in plastics, textiles, and chemicals. These wealthy Taiwanese were directly \\\"asked\\\" by the government to invest. \\\"What generally happened was that one of the ministers in the government would call a businessman in Taiwan,\\\" Chang explained, \\\"to get him to invest.\\\" From day one, TSMC was not really a private business: it was a project of the Taiwanese state.

      "            \"<Document source=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia\\\" page=\\\"\\\"/>\\nNvidia Corporation ( en-VID-ee-ə) is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, and incorporated in Delaware. Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang (president and CEO), Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, it is a software and fabless company which designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs) for data science and high-performance computing, and system on a chip units (SoCs) for mobile computing and the automotive market. Nvidia is also a dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software.\\nNvidia's professional line of GPUs are used for edge-to-cloud computing and in supercomputers and workstations for applications in fields such as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research, and manufacturing design. Its GeForce line of GPUs are aimed at the consumer market and are used in applications such as video editing, 3D rendering, and PC gaming. With a market share of 80.2% in the second quarter of 2023, Nvidia leads the market for discrete desktop GPUs by a wide margin. The company expanded its presence in the gaming industry with the introduction of the Shield Portable (a handheld game console), Shield Tablet (a gaming tablet), and Shield TV (a digital media player), as well as its cloud gaming service GeForce Now.\\nIn addition to GPU design and outsourcing manufacturing, Nvidia provides the CUDA software platform and API that allows the creation of massively parallel programs which utilize GPUs. They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. In the late 2000s, Nvidia had moved into the mobile computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets and vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. Its competitors include AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, and AI accelerator companies such as Cerebras and Graphcore. It also makes AI-powered software for audio and video processing (e.g., Nvidia Maxine).\\nNvidia's offer to acquire Arm from SoftBank in September 2020 failed to materialize following extended regulatory scrutiny, leading to the termination of the deal in February 2022 in what would have been the largest semiconductor acquisition. In 2023, Nvidia became the seventh public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion, and the company's valuation has increased rapidly since then as the company became a leader in data center chips with AI capabilities in the midst of the AI boom. In June 2024, for one day, Nvidia overtook Microsoft as the world's most valuable publicly traded company, with a market capitalization of over $3.3 trillion.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Founding ===\\n\\nNvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang (who, as of 2024, remains CEO), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems. The three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a Denny's roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose.\\nAt the time, Malachowsky and Priem were frustrated with Sun's management and were looking to leave, but Huang was on \\\"firmer ground\\\", in that he was already running his own division at LSI. The three co-founders discussed a vision of the future which was so compelling that Huang decided to leave LSI and become the chief executive officer of their new startup.\\nIn 1993, the three co-founders envisioned that the ideal trajectory for the forthcoming wave of computing would be in the realm of accelerated computing, specifically in graphics-based processing. This path was chosen due to its unique ability to tackle challenges that eluded general-purpose computing methods. As Huang later explained: \\\"We also observed that video games were simultan\\n</Document>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<Document source=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC\\\" page=\\\"\\\"/>\\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC or Taiwan Semiconductor) is a Taiwanese multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company. It is the world's most valuable semiconductor company, the world's largest dedicated independent (\\\"pure-play\\\") semiconductor foundry, and Taiwan's largest company, with headquarters and main operations located in the Hsinchu Science Park in Hsinchu, Taiwan. Although the central government of Taiwan is the largest individual shareholder, the majority of TSMC is owned by foreign investors. In 2023, the company was ranked 44th in the Forbes Global 2000. Taiwan's exports of integrated circuits amounted to $184 billion in 2022, accounted for nearly 25 percent of Taiwan's GDP. TSMC constitutes about 30 percent of the Taiwan Stock Exchange's main index.\\nTSMC was founded in Taiwan in 1987 by Morris Chang as the world's first dedicated semiconductor foundry. It has long been the leading company in its field. When Chang retired in 2018, after 31 years of TSMC leadership, Mark Liu became chairman and C. C. Wei became Chief Executive. It has been listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange since 1993; in 1997 it became the first Taiwanese company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Since 1994, TSMC has had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.4% in revenue and a CAGR of 16.1% in earnings.\\nMost fabless semiconductor companies such as AMD, Apple, ARM, Broadcom, Marvell, MediaTek, Qualcomm, and Nvidia are customers of TSMC, as are emerging companies such as Allwinner Technology, HiSilicon, Spectra7, and UNISOC. Programmable logic device companies Xilinx and previously Altera also make or made use of TSMC's foundry services. Some integrated device manufacturers that have their own fabrication facilities, such as Intel, NXP, STMicroelectronics, and Texas Instruments, outsource some of their production to TSMC. At least one semiconductor company, LSI, re-sells TSMC wafers through its ASIC design services and design IP portfolio.\\nTSMC has a global capacity of about thirteen million 300 mm-equivalent wafers per year as of 2020 and produces chips for customers with process nodes from 2 microns to 3 nanometres. TSMC was the first foundry to market 7-nanometre and 5-nanometre (used by the 2020 Apple A14 and M1 SoCs, the MediaTek Dimensity 8100, and AMD Ryzen 7000 series processors) production capabilities, and the first to commercialize ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology in high volume.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nIn 1986, Li Kwoh-ting, representing the Executive Yuan, invited Morris Chang to serve as the president of the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) and offered him a blank check to build Taiwan's chip industry. At that time, the Taiwanese government wanted to develop its semiconductor industry, but its high investment and high risk nature made it difficult to find investors. Texas Instruments and Intel turned down Chang. Only Philips was willing to sign a joint venture contract with Taiwan to put up $58 million, transfer its production technology, and license intellectual property in exchange for a 27.5 percent stake in TSMC. Alongside generous tax benefits, the Taiwanese government, through the National Development Fund, Executive Yuan, provided another 48 percent of the startup capital for TSMC, and the rest of the capital was raised from several of the island's wealthiest families, who owned firms that specialized in plastics, textiles, and chemicals. These wealthy Taiwanese were directly \\\"asked\\\" by the government to invest. \\\"What generally happened was that one of the ministers in the government would call a businessman in Taiwan,\\\" Chang explained, \\\"to get him to invest.\\\" From day one, TSMC was not really a private business: it was a project of the Taiwanese state. Its first CEO was James E. Dykes, who left after a year and Morris Chang became the CEO.\\nSince then, the company has continued to grow, albeit subject to the cycles of demand.
